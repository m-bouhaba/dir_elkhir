# Hero background image

The hero section uses a **Moroccan-themed image** (tradition, solidarity) from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/morocco) by default.

## Use your own image (e.g. from Pinterest)

1. **Download** the image from your pin:
   - [Morocco – hands, food, solidarity](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1022457921657578338/)
   - [Quick Saves / Moroccan style](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/813462751484286431/)
   - [Morrocan style – collage](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/773141461061102174/)

2. **Save it** in this folder as: **`hero-moroccan.png`** (or `.jpg`).

3. **Update the hero** in `src/components/hero-section.tsx`: change the `Image` `src` from the Unsplash URL to **`/images/hero-moroccan.png`** (or your filename).

The overlay in the hero keeps text readable; use an image that fits “tradition and solidarity.”
